# Python-Binance

Hi there,

As some of us want to learn some python, some crypto and, eventually, be rich (when moon?). I will be posting some of my code, so you can use it as well. There is no guarantee this can work on your system or not. I don't provide support, this is just a hobby. Feel free you give feedback.

If you find something can be improved, please let me know. Ideas welcomed!

* Websocket-open-close.py is about opening and closing multiplex websockets on Binance, so you can avoid the Binance 24h limit. It's a Simple Spell But Quite Unbreakable.
* Forense.py takes a look aome minutes back, so you can watch again what happenend during that pum/dump which made you rich/poor.
* Moving_average_plot.py asks you for a symbol and then plots the price and a couple of EMAs.
