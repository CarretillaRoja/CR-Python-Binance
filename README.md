# Python-Binance

Hi there,

As some of us want to learn some python, some crypto and, eventually, be rich (when moon?). I will be posting some of my code, so you can use it as well.

If you find something can be improved, please let me know. Ideas welcomed!

* Websocket-open-close.py is about opening and closing multiplex websockets on Binance, so you can avoid the 24h limit. It's a Simple Spell But Quite Unbreakable.
